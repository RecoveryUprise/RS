  <p><strong>Director of Youth Services | Systems Architect | Public Health Advocate</strong><br>
     Systems Builder · Youth Recovery Advocate · Nonprofit Leader</p>

  <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
  <p>I’m a values-driven leader with deep roots in direct service and a passion for building systems that work for youth and families. Over the past five years at 4D Recovery, I’ve moved from frontline mentorship into senior leadership—developing programs that meet people where they are, honor lived experience, and open real pathways to healing, connection, and opportunity.

What drives me is the belief that meaningful change happens when we combine empathy with structure, and creativity with accountability. I bring a forward-thinking mindset to complex challenges—drawing from lived experience, systems thinking, and a relentless commitment to doing the right thing, even when it’s hard.

In parallel with my program leadership, I’ve built data systems and reporting tools that elevate outcomes that matter—empowering frontline teams and ensuring our work meets both participant needs and funder expectations. From launching trauma-informed, youth-led recovery models to securing sustainable public funding, I’ve helped build responsive, people-first programs that are measurable, scalable, and rooted in community values.

Now, I’m focused on scaling that impact through public service—bridging the gap between direct practice and policy. My long-term goal is to help build a comprehensive, youth-centered system by bringing practical experience and systems design into the legislative process, ensuring policy reflects the realities of those it’s meant to serve.</p>
